Feature: Viewing a project status page
  As a member of the specification team
  I want to be able to see a status page for each project
  So that I can see how much of the specs are implemented

  Scenario: Valid project
  Scenario: Invalid project
  Scenario: Complete Project
  Scenario: Partially Completed Project
  Scenario: Project with invalid specifications
